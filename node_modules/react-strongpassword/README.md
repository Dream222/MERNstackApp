React StrongPassword
=============

Password field react component, with built in password quality gauge based on 
[zxcvbn](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/) password strength meter library.

* * *

This react component aims to improve common issues in password field UX.

1.  **Password Strength Detection** - Using Dropbox's [zxcvbn](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/) library in real-time, onChange.
2.  **Timed Password Masking** - Best explained in the [nngroup](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/stop-password-masking/) article: [Stop Password Masking](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/stop-password-masking/)
3.  **Stateful Class** - Know the HTML5 validity of your field by class.

## Install

```npm install react-strongpassword```

## Use

``` javascript
import StrongPassword from 'react-strongpassword';

...

render: function() {
    return (
        <form>
            ...
            <StrongPassword />
            ...
        </form>
    )
}
```

## Options (props)

React StrongPassword will work fine with its defaults, but there are configuration options that can help 
you adapt it to your project's needs.

* `infoBar` - show password strength information as a progressbar below the input field itself. Default - `true`.
* `statusInactiveColor` - bar color for status when the field is empty and not active yet. Default - `#C0C0C0`.
* `statusInvalidColor` - bar color for status when the password provided is not yet valid, e.g. too short, too weak etc. Default - `#FF0000`.
* `minScore` - minimum acceptable password strength score, 0 to 4. Default - `0`.
* `minLength` - minimum acceptable password length, chars. Default - `6`.
* `toggleMask` - whether to turn on password masking (`true`) after a small delay or leave it visible all the time (`false`). Default - `true`.
* `unMaskTime` - password masking delay, in milliseconds since last input event. Default - `1400`.
* strengthStages` - an object defining colors and hover tooltips for five levels of password strength. Default:
``` javascript
[{word: "Weak", color: "#FF8800"}, 
{word: "Okay", color: "#FFFF00"},
{word: "Good", color: "#6666FF"}, 
{word: "Strong", color: "#009900"}, 
{word: "Great", color: "#00EE00"}]
```
